# Purposeful

## Company Purpose

Purposeful exists to use the best of brain science to build high-performing individuals, teams, and organizations.

## First Product

The first Purposeful product will be an "Offistes" tool for startup founders. This tool will help a founding team understand some of their brain and how it works and give context for how to run a great offsite/strategy/planning session.

The tool we build will be a web UI with the following features:

1. Educational video content to teach people about the brain and how that relates to them building high performance habits
2. Forms for them to enter information that will be needed to craft an optimal slide deck for them to bring to their offsite/strategy/planning session
3. The ability for them to download their slide deck as a PDF.
